DESCRIPTION

The folder contains the files/folders used in the Controls Tech Talk titled "Understanding Control Systems, Part 5: Simulating Robustness to System Variations in Simulink".

***********************************************
This folder contains the following items:

1-'Open_loop_system.slx': This Simulink model simulates robustness of the open-loop control system to system variations.

2-'Closed_loop_system': This Simulink model simulates robustness of the closed-loop control system to system variations.

3-MeldasLibrary.slx: This is the custom library used in the Controls Tech Talk.

4-slblocks.m: This is the m-file that adds the custom library to the Simulink Library Browser. This m-file should be on your MATLAB path.

5-'Mask icons' folder: This folder contains the mask icons used in the custom library (Melda's Library).  

*************************************************
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE SIMULINK MODELS:

Download the folder titled "Simulating Robustness to System Variations in Simulink" to your computer and set it as your MATLAB path. You can open and run any of the Simulink models provided with this folder. You can open the Simulink Library Browser to display the custom library titled 'Melda's Library'.
