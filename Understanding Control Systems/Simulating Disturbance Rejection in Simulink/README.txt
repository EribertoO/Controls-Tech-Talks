The folder contains the files/folders used in the Controls Tech Talk titled "Understanding Control Systems, Part 4: Simulating Disturbance Rejection in Simulink".

***********************************************
This folder contains the following items:

1-'Understanding_Control_Systems.slx': This Simulink model shows the open-loop control system of the car example demonstrated in the Controls Tech Talk.

2-'Understanding_Control_Systems_2.slx': This Simulink model shows the open-loop control system of the car example in the presence of disturbances.

3-'Understanding_Control_Systems_3.slx': This Simulink model shows the feedback control system of the car example in the presence of disturbances.

4-MeldasLibrary.slx: This is the custom library used in the Controls Tech Talk.

5-slblocks.m: This is the m-file that adds the custom library to the Simulink Library Browser. This m-file should be on your MATLAB path.

6-'Mask icons' folder: This folder contains the mask icons used in the custom library (Melda's Library).
